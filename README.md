Online ratings of e-products are vital factors in the rapid growth of e-commerce platforms for several commodities and products.
Typical rating system employs a band score of 1-5 and online rating visualisation gives: votes per rating, average rating and total votes for the product.
We argue that conventional online rating displays become outdated with a high number of votes or prolonged product exposure. We advocate for a novel Online Rating Visualization system (ORV) for more immediate and dynamic representation of rating votes.
This is formulated using multi-bin visualisation(MBV) approach that decomposes the rating-votes in small multiple time bins.
